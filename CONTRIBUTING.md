# open-gunz

Open GunZ was originally created to centralize development on GunZ 1.0 source (Refined GunZ). The project maintainers eventually started their own private server (https://igunz.net) and stopped maintaining [open-gunz](https://github.com/open-gunz). **While open-gunz is not being maintained by active members this repository is being maintained under the rusty-gunz umbrella.** The goal of the rusty-gunz gunz-1.0 fork is to limit divergence with potential igunz contribution expectations through July 2021. The expectation is for rusty-gunz 1.0 fork contributions to be merged with open-gunz in the summer of 2021.

# gunz-1.0

As part of general rusty-gunz org goals, speed of development and general dev experience are some of the top priorities for this fork. Some of the planned work includes:

- Vagrantfile for linux debug and builds
- Client Docker images for dynamic clients
- Automated deployment and general standardization improvements
- C++ and Rust binding experiments

## Maintenance on the fork

Since the igunz project "fork", open-source maintenance of open-gunz halted. Any contributions to this fork will be managed by rusty-gunz org. Join the rusty-gunz discord server if you'd like to collaborate.
